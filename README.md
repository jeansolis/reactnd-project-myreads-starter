# MyReads Project

In the MyReads project, you can manage a bookshelf, categorize books (Currently reading, Want to read, and read). And also, you can search for books that you would like to add to your current bookshelf.

## TL;DR

To install and launch the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
